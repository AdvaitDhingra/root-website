An overview page like http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html is needed. 
On the left side, for example, the list of classes is displayed (that is 
always visible) and on the right side the description of the selected class.

The Doxgen-Output. At the moment, the output is neither structured (no grouping by topic) nor is it displayed in a suitable layout (no left side navigation). Doxgen is more flexible and we need to find a way to produce a more user-friendly output.
We do not use the term “Reference Guide” anymore.
