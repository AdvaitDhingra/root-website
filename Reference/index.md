An overview page like [this one](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html) is needed. 
On the left side, for example, the list of classes is displayed (that is 
always visible) and on the right side the description of the selected class.

We are working on the [Doxygen-Output](https://root.cern/doc/master/) to make it structured 
(grouping by topic) and displayed in a suitable layout (left side navigation). 
We do not use the term “Reference Guide” anymore.
