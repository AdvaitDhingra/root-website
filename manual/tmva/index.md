The Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis with ROOT (TMVA) provides a machine learning environment for the processing and evaluation of multivariate classification, both binary and multi-class, and regression techniques targeting applications in high-energy physics. The package includes:

- Neural networks
- Deep networks
- Multilayer perceptron
- Boosted/Bagged decision trees
- Function discriminant analysis (FDA)
- Multidimensional probability density estimation (PDE - range-search approach)
- Multidimensional k-nearest neighbour classifier
- Predictive learning via rule ensembles (RuleFit)
- Projective likelihood estimation (PDE approach)
- Rectangular cut optimisation
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
