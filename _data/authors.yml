Axel Naumann:
  name        : "Axel Naumann"
  bio         : "Starting off as a physicist, Axel studied physics and math in Muenster,
                 Germany. In 2000, he got a Ph.D. position for high energy physics in
                 Nijmegen, The Netherlands. They sent him to Fermilab at Chicago, where he
                 worked with the DØ experiment - which also meant writing software from PCI
                 drivers to data analysis code. During that time he got involved with ROOT,
                 converting from a user to a developer. He contributed to whatever he
                 needed, e.g. the statistics part, the documentation engine, and porting it
                 to cygwin. After a position with the Fermilab Computing Division in 2005
                 he ended up at CERN in the ROOT development team. Axel is leading the ROOT
                 project since 2017."

Bertrand Bellenot:
  name        : "Bertrand Bellenot"
  bio         : "Bertrand was primary working in Aluminum industry as process engineer,
                 developing software for data acquisition, data analysis, statistical
                 process control (SPC) and for X-Ray spectrometry. He has been involved in
                 ROOT development since 2001 by porting ROOT to Windows. Bertrand is a
                 member of the ROOT development team at CERN since August 2005. He's
                 currently working on GUI (Graphical User Interface), core (mainly Windows
                 support), and JavaScript Root (JSROOT)."

Enric Tejedor:
  name        : "Enric Tejedor"
  bio         : "Enric Tejedor received his Ph.D. from the Technical University of Catalonia
                 (UPC, Spain) in 2013. He conducted his doctorate research as a member of
                 the Grid Computing and Clusters group of the Barcelona Supercomputing
                 Center, where his researched focused on parallel programming models for
                 distributed infrastructures and where he participated in several EU
                 research projects. As part of his Ph.D., he also carried out two
                 nternships at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center (NY, USA).  In 2015 he
                 joined the CERN EP-SFT group as a senior fellow and later became a staff
                 member. He is currently working on ROOT parallelization, the ROOT Python
                 bindings and the SWAN service. He is also one of the administrators of the
                 Google Summer of Code student program (GSoC) at CERN-HEP Software Foundation."

Lorenzo Moneta:
  name        : "Lorenzo Moneta"
  bio         : "Lorenzo started working in 1989 as an experimental physicist for the ALEPH
                 experiment working for data analysis and software event reconstruction. He
                 graduated in Pisa in 1990 and he received his Ph.D. in particle physics in
                 1994 at the University of Florence. Afterwards, since 1997, he was working
                 for data analysis of the CDF experiments and online software for the ATLAS
                 experiment. In 2002 he joined the physics application software group of
                 CERN, and since 2005 he joined the ROOT team with the responsibility of
                 the Math work package, which provides development and support for the ROOT
                 mathematical and statistical libraries."

Olivier Couet:
  name        : "Olivier Couet"
  bio         : "Olivier Couet received a Physic's Master from the  Strasbourg University
                 and a Master’s Degree in Engineering from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure
                 de Physique de Strasbourg (ENSPS) on work in computer graphics and image
                 processing in 1985. He then performed his Ph.D work (in Computer Graphics)
                 at the Laboratoire D'Annecy le Vieux de Physique des Particules (LAPP)
                 on the PAW project. He has been employed by CERN since 1988. He was one
                 of the main authors of the PAW system, more precisely its graphical
                 components (HIGZ and HPLOT). HIGZ has been the standard graphics package
                 in High Energy Physics for years and is still being used. He was
                 responsible for the PAW system from 1995 until he joined the ROOT team
                 in 2002 and took responsibility of the graphics work package."
