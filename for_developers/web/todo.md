Here are the points captured during the team meeting. Please make sure
we don't drop things from it - not everything needs to be done by yous,
but we should be aware of what still needs to be done (before we go live).

### Web site
   - [ ] Don't open in new window / tab
   - [X] Link for C++: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp
   - [X] Collaborate: "to the ROOT" -> "to ROOT"
   - [ ] Make right "On this page" box scrollable, somehow; see e.g. ROOT Primer
   - [X] Front page: align "Under the Spotlight" and "Other News" titles
   - [X] "Other News" -> "Tech Blog"
   - [X] Put "Latest Releases" on top of "Tech Blog"
   - [X] Increase the font size of the title of "Under the Spotlight"
   - [X] "ROOT is..." Don't mention R
   - [X] "Latest Releases": don't use monotype?
   - [X] "Latest Releases": remove extra indent of "Release 6.xx.yy..."
   - [X] Front page: icon titles should be considerable larger
   - [X] Consider using the "ROOT is..." paragraph font (i.e. "default font") also for the colored boxes below
   - [ ] Reference latest "pro" release for all reference guide links
   - [X] Need to fix search before going online
   - [ ] Auto complete in search
   - [X] Use site map provided by this [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap) plugin.
   - [ ] Weird box around topic link when hitting the "back" button - talk to Axel
   - [ ] "Using ROOT" logos: Fermilab, CSCS, NERSC, GSI
   - [X] Provide tiny step-by-step page for editing pages
   - [X] Footer: " © Copyright CERN 2014-18. All rights reserved. " update year
   - [X] Footer: add contact info: forum, bug reports, else rootdev@cern.ch
   - [X] Add "About..." in top menu on main page, to link to "More..."-page
   - [X] Rename "Resources" to "For Developers"
   - [X] Remove all of "Building ROOT with make (old method)"
   - [X] Get rid of "old" vs "pro" tags; just show the latest production release and "others".
   - [X] Remove "Release candidate
     A release candidate is a preview of the next production release. It
     allows users to make their code ready for the new production release,
     and to provide early feedback."
   - [ ] Specific ROOT version? Download our `<a href="...">binary</a>`
   - [ ] "Using Fedora? dnf install..."
   - [ ] "Conda? conda ..."
   - [ ] "Docker? Get image here..."
   - [ ] "do you have /cvmfs? ..."
   - [ ] "At CERN on lxplus? You have root 6.18!"

### Reference guide
   - [ ] "List of all members" twice
   
### Manual
   - [ ] Make sure we are not lossing information from the user's guide
         which are not in the référence guide.
   - [ ] Scan the most accessed thread in the forum and reflect them in the Manual
   - [ ] Change the links to the tutorials pages to a more visible "eye-catching" icon
   - [ ] Extract the fitting part of the histogram section to make make a new section
         related to fitting and put it close to the Roofit one in the left side menu of 
         the manual.
   - [ ] Shorten the "On this page" menu to make sure they are fully visible.
