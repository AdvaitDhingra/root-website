Before using ROOT, it must be installed successfully and all environment variables must be set.
→ See [Installation Guide]({{ '/Resources/Building_ROOT' | relative_url }}).

You can start and quit a ROOT session on the system prompt,
 → see [Starting and quitting a ROOT session](starting_and_quitting_root_sessions).

ROOT provides an interactive C++ interpreter Cling, where you can execute simple or
multi-line commands,
→ see [Using the interactive C++ interpreter Cling](using_the_interactive_c++_interpreter_cling).

A ROOT macro can consist of simple or multi-line commands, but also of arbitrarily complex
class and function definitions. You can create, compile and execute ROOT macros,
→ see [ROOT macros](root_macros).

When you install ROOT, a tutorials directory is copied that contains a lot of tutorials.
A ROOT tutorial is a ROOT macro that demonstrates ROOT specific features,
→ see [ROOT tutorials](root_tutorials).

With Cling commands you can control ROOT,
→ see [Using Cling commands to control ROOT](using_cling_commands_to_control_root).
