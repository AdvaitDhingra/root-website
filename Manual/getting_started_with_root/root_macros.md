A ROOT macro contains pure C++ code, which additionally can contain ROOT classes and other
ROOT objects (→ see *ROOT classes*). A ROOT macro can consist of simple or multi-line commands,
but also of arbitrarily complex class and function definitions.

ROOT provides a lot of tutorials that are available as ROOT macros
(→ see [ROOT tutorials]({{ '/Manual/getting_started_with_root/root_tutorials' | relative_url }}))

You can save a ROOT macro in a file and execute it at the ROOT prompt or the system prompt.
