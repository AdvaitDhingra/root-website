ROOT offers a rich set of code examples that allow you to see ROOT's building blocks "in action", as part of more complex programs. They are separated in two categories: C++ or python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

The tutorials are available for all major ROOT releases. [These](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html) are the links for the latest git snapshot. All scripts are available also in the form of a **ROOTBook** which can be visualized in [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) or tried out interactively in [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch). Just look for these badges:
