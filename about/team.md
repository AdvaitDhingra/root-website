<img src="{{'/assets/images/AN.jpg' | relative_url}}" width="30%" style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;">
Starting off as a physicist, Axel studied physics and math in Muenster, Germany. In 2000,
he got a Ph.D. position for high energy physics in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. They sent
him to Fermilab at Chicago, where he worked with the DØ experiment - which also meant
writing software from PCI drivers to data analysis code. During that time he got involved
with ROOT, converting from a user to a developer. He contributed to whatever he needed,
e.g. the statistics part, the documentation engine, and porting it to cygwin. After a
position with the Fermilab Computing Division in 2005 he ended up at CERN in the ROOT
development team. Axel is leading the ROOT project since 2017.
