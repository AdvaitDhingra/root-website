title:  "Full Totem Analysis based on RDataFrame and distributed on a big Spark cluster with PyRDF!"
---

Milosz Blaszkiewicz and Aleksandra Mnich (AGH University of Science and Technology - Poland) wanted to evaluate a set of Big Data tools for the analysis of the data from the TOTEM experiment which will enable interactive or semi-interactive work with large amounts of data. They ended up re-implementing a full Totem analysis in a declarative fashion using RDataFrame and distributing their calculations over a big Spark cluster with PyRDF.
