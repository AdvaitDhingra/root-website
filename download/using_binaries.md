After unpacking/installing the binaries and before using ROOT, use the following script distributed with ROOT:

{% highlight C++ %}
   source <pathname>/root/bin/thisroot.sh
{% endhighlight %}

`<pathname>` is the location where you unpacked the ROOT distribution.<br>
Add these lines to your `.profile` or `.login` files.<br>
There are versions for `[t]csh` and `fish`, too.
