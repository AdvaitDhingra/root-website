Overview page like https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/
This kind of page requires that the tutorials are grouped by topic.

The tutorials as we have them now. May we rewrite them too, but first, we need to group them by topic. Currently we have long, boring list. I am sure that there are subject areas to which certain tutorials can be assigned. The list needs a structure. It doesn't have to be a list carved in stone, but it does have to be structured.
We do not use the word “HowTos” anymore on the new website.
